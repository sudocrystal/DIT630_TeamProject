## Abstract 
This study uses public financial data from community colleges in Oregon, focusing on expenses and revenues for many colleges from academic years 2007-2008 to 2021-2022. The data has been meticulously cleaned for predictive use in the sourcing and allocation of funds for colleges in the state. The intent is to produce descriptive analysis and variances between how different schools use their funds between funding sources. As such, the data will be used for prediction via linear modelling, which is meant to help determine trends in expenditures and revenues by comparing the colleges and trends over time. To help present the data and findings in a more digestible format, visualizations will be generated to better present and represent the data, which can be used to inform higher education leadersâ€™ decision-making.
